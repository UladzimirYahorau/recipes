Mirza Ghasemi - Persian Eggplant Dip


Ingredients:
 - 4 eggplants
 - 2 garlic cloves
 - 2 eggs
 - 1 tomatoes
 - 2 tablespoons oil
 - salt
 - black pepper

Directions:
 1. Grill the eggplants in the oven or on stove top.

 5. Fry the chopped garlic with the oil, add eggplant and the chopped tomatoes.
 6. Add salt and pepper and fry till excess of water is gone.
